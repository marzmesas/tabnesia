# Tabnesia

Tabnesia is a Chrome extension that helps you manage your browser tabs by tracking tab usage and identifying forgotten tabs.

## Features

- **Tab Analytics**: View statistics about your open tabs, including total count, grouped tabs, and forgotten tabs.
- **Recently Inactive Tabs**: See tabs you haven't visited recently but are still within the 30-day active period.
- **Forgotten Tabs**: Identify tabs that haven't been accessed in over 30 days, helping you clean up your browser.
- **Tab Details**: View detailed information about any tab, including its URL, access time, and group membership.
- **Collapsible Sections**: Easily expand or collapse sections to focus on what matters to you.

## How It Works

Tabnesia tracks when you access your tabs and categorizes them based on their last access time:

1. **Recently Inactive Tabs**: Tabs you haven't visited recently but have been accessed within the last 30 days.
2. **Forgotten Tabs**: Tabs that haven't been accessed for more than 30 days.

The extension provides a clean, intuitive interface with statistics about your tabs and allows you to manage them more effectively.
