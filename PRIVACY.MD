# Privacy Policy for Tabnesia Chrome Extension

**Effective Date:** April 21st 2025

Thank you for using Tabnesia. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains what information the Extension accesses and how it is used. This Extension is designed to operate entirely locally within your browser.

**1. Information We Access**

To provide its features, the Extension requires access to the following browser data:

*   **Tab Information:** Access to details about your open tabs, including their URLs, titles, IDs, active status, and grouping status (via the `tabs` and `tabGroups` permissions). This is necessary to list and analyze your tabs.
*   **Browsing History:** Access to your browsing history (via the `history` permission) is used specifically to determine the last accessed time or usage frequency of tabs, enabling the identification of "Old Tabs" and "Unused Tabs".
*   **Website Favicons:** Access to website URLs (via the `<all_urls>` host permission) is used **solely** to fetch and display the corresponding favicon (website icon) next to each tab listed within the Extension's interface. This improves visual identification of tabs. The Extension does **not** read, modify, or collect content from these websites.
*   **Local Storage:** Access to browser storage (via the `storage` permission) is used exclusively to save your user interface preferences, specifically your chosen theme (light or dark).

**2. How We Use Information**

The information accessed is used solely for the following purposes **within your local browser**:

*   To display lists of active, inactive, and old tabs with their titles and favicons.
*   To calculate and display tab analytics based on locally processed tab and history data.
*   To allow you to manage your tabs (e.g., close tabs) directly from the Extension interface.
*   To remember your chosen theme setting between sessions.

**All data processing happens locally on your computer within the Chrome browser environment. The Extension does not collect, transmit, or store your browsing data (URLs, history, tab content) on any remote servers.**

**3. Data Storage**

*   **Browsing Data:** Your tab information, browsing history, and website favicons are processed in real-time and are **not** stored persistently by the Extension, except potentially in temporary memory during use.
*   **User Settings:** Your selected theme preference is the only piece of data stored persistently, using Chrome's `chrome.storage.local` API, which stores data locally on your device.

**4. Data Sharing**

We **do not** share any of the information accessed by the Extension with any third parties. The data remains local to your browser and under your control. We do not sell or transfer your data.

**5. Security**

We rely on the security mechanisms provided by the Google Chrome browser and the `chrome.storage.local` API to protect the minimal settings data stored locally. Since no browsing data is transmitted or stored remotely, the risk associated with data breaches is minimized.

**6. Children's Privacy**

The Extension is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13.

**7. Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy at the URL where this policy is hosted. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
